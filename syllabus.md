[AP Computer Science Conceptual Framework](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-conceptual-framework-2020-21.pdf)

Consistent with the AP Computer Science Principles curriculum framework, the course’s material is organized around five so-called “big ideas” as well as six computational thinking practices. The five big ideas are:

1. Creative Development (CRD)
2. Data (DAT)
3. Algorithms and Programming (AAP)
4. Computing Systems and Networks (CSN)
5. Impact of Computing (IOC)

And the six computational thinking practices are:

1. Computational Solution Design (P1)
2. Algorithms and Program Development (P2)
3. Abstraction in Program Development (P3)
4. Code Analysis (P4)
5. Computing Innovations (P5)
6. Responsible Computing (P6)


## Course Introduction <a name="ci"></a>

CS50 is Harvard University’s introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming for students less comfortable and more comfortable alike. CS50 for AP Computer Science Principles is an adaptation of CS50 for high schools that aligns with the AP Computer Science Principles curriculum framework. The course assumes no prior background of students, but it is rigorous by design and programming-centric, engaging students with fundamentals of computer science by way of hands-on programming projects. The computational-thinking skills that students ultimately acquire are broadly applicable.

Among this course’s objectives is to supply students with a comprehensive introduction to the fundamentals of the discipline of computer science. We will do so using programming in several different languages as a vehicle to introduce these fundamentals, including such topics as algorithms, abstraction, data, global impact, and internet technologies. Though the course is programming-heavy, it should be stressed that this is not a “programming course”; rather, this course should be considered one of problem-solving, creativity, and exploration. By year’s end, students will have a richer understanding of the key principles of the discipline of computer science. They will be able to speak intelligently about how computers work and how they enable us to become better problem-solvers and will hopefully be able to communicate that knowledge to others.

Whether students elect to take no other computer science courses in their lifetime or consider this class the first step in a longer course of study, it is our sincere hope that students feel more comfortable with—and indeed sometimes skeptical of—the technologies that surround us each day.

## Prerequisites <a name="pre"></a>

The only background required for CS50 for AP Computer Science Principles is completion of Algebra I or its equivalent.

## Recommended Books <a name="rb"></a>

No books are required for this course. However, students may wish to supplement their preparation for or review of some material with self-assigned readings relevant to the material from either of the books below. The first is intended for those inexperienced in (or less comfortable with the idea of) programming. The second is intended for those experienced in (or more comfortable with the idea of) programming. Realize that free, if not superior, resources can be found on the course’s website or on the internet more generally.

## Programming Environments <a name="enviro"></a>

Several programming languages are taught in the course, and students are able to program in all of them in an environment designed specifically for the course called VSCode for CS50. Students will need to sign up for a (free) GitHub account in order to use VSCode for CS50.

VSCode for CS50 is a web-based utility with cloud storage, meaning students will be able to work on the course’s programming exercises at home, school, or anywhere they have an internet connection. Instructions for setting up and using VSCode for CS50 are provided in the first assignment requiring its use.

Additionally, students will use a drag-and-drop programming language called Scratch for some of the course’s early material. Scratch is similarly a web-based environment.

## Academic Honesty <a name="ah"></a>

This course’s philosophy on academic honesty is best stated as “be reasonable.” The course recognizes that interactions with classmates and others can facilitate mastery of the course’s material. However, there remains a line between enlisting the help of another and submitting the work of another. This policy characterizes both sides of that line.

The essence of all work that you submit to this course must be your own. Collaboration on problems is not permitted (unless explicitly stated otherwise) except to the extent that you may ask classmates and others for help so long as that help does not reduce to another doing your work for you. **Generally speaking, when asking for help, you may show your code or writing to others, but you may not view theirs, so long as you and they respect this policy’s other constraints.**

Collaboration on the course’s quizzes and tests is not permitted at all. Collaboration on the Create Performance Task is permitted to the extent prescribed by its specifications.

Below are examples that inexhaustibly characterize acts that the course considers reasonable and not reasonable. If in doubt as to whether some act is reasonable, do not commit it until you solicit and receive approval in writing from your instructor. If a violation of this policy is suspected and confirmed, your instructor reserves the right to impose an appropriate penalty.

### Reasonable <a name="reasonable"></a>

* Communicating with classmates about problems in English (or some other spoken language).
* Discussing the course’s material with others in order to understand it better.
* Helping a classmate identify a bug in his or her code, such as by viewing, compiling, or running his or her code, even on your own computer.
* Incorporating snippets of code that you find online or elsewhere into your own code, provided that those snippets are not themselves solutions to assigned problems and that you cite the snippets’ origins (as via comments in your code).
* Reviewing past years’ quizzes, tests, and solutions thereto.
* Sending or showing code that you’ve written to someone, possibly a classmate, so that he or she might help you identify and fix a bug.
* Sharing snippets of your own solutions to problems online so that others might help you identify and fix a bug or other issue.
* Turning to the web or elsewhere for instruction beyond the course’s own, for references, and for solutions to technical difficulties, but not for outright solutions to problems or your own Create Task.
* Whiteboarding solutions to problems with others using diagrams or pseudocode but not actual code.
* Working with (and even paying) a tutor to help you with the course, provided the tutor does not do your work for you.

### Not Reasonable <a name="unreasonable"></a>

* Accessing a solution to some problem prior to (re-)submitting your own.
* Asking a classmate to see his or her solution to a problem before (re-)submitting your own.
* Decompiling, deobfuscating, or disassembling the sample solutions to problems available in CS50 IDE.
* Failing to cite (as with comments) the origins of code, writing, or techniques that you discover outside of the course’s own lessons and integrate into your own work, even while respecting this policy’s other constraints.
* Giving or showing to a classmate a solution to a problem when it is he or she, and not you, who is struggling to solve it.
* Looking at another individual’s work during a quiz or test.
* Paying or offering to pay an individual for work that you may submit as (part of) your own.
* Providing or making available solutions to problems to individuals who might take this course in the future.
* Searching for, soliciting, or viewing a quiz’s questions or answers prior to taking the quiz.
* Searching for or soliciting outright solutions to problems online or elsewhere.
* Splitting a problem’s workload with another individual and combining your work (unless explicitly authorized by the problem itself).
* Submitting (after possibly modifying) the work of another individual beyond allowed snippets.
* Submitting the same or similar work to this course that you have submitted or will submit to another.
* Using resources during a quiz or test beyond those explicitly allowed in the quiz’s or test’s instructions.
* Viewing another’s solution to a problem and basing your own solution on it.

## Assessment <a name="assessment"></a>

Because computer science is not a discipline that only lends itself to questions of right and wrong but also how and why, this course’s assessment policy is designed to try to answer some or all of these questions. The course’s problems are evaluated along two axes: correctness and style.

#### Correctness

To what extent is your submission consistent with our specification and free of bugs or errors?

#### Style

To what extent is your submission readable (i.e., code is commented and indented with aptly named variables)?

To obtain a passing grade in the course, all students must ordinarily submit all assigned problems unless otherwise granted an exception in writing by the instructor.

## Curriculum <a name="curr"></a>

CS50 for AP Computer Science Principles includes materials from CS50T (Understanding Technology) and CS50x (Introduction to Computer Science) as well as two AP-specific modules (Data Science and Impact of Computing).

### CS50T

In this module, students learn about how it all works underneath the hood and how to solve problems when something goes wrong, this course fills in the gaps, empowering students to use and troubleshoot technology more effectively.

#### Topics within this Module

1. Hardware
2. Internet
3. Multimedia
4. Security

### CS50x

#### Scratch

In this module, students will learn about how data is represented in their computer and the language of computers – binary, how information is encoded so that humans can understand it and begin to explore the ways in which computers process information.

* Binary
* ASCII
* Algorithms
* Pseudocode
* Scratch

#### C

In this module, students will learn the fundamentals of computer programming, to permit them to begin to manipulate information and data and command a computer to do calculations they wish for it to perform.

* Syntax
* Variables
* Data Types
* Operators
* Boolean Expressions and Conditionals
* Loops

#### Arrays

In this module, students will expand upon their knowledge of the fundamentals of computer programming and begin building abstractions of their own. They’ll also learn about strategies for debugging their own programs.

* Compiling
* Debugging
* Arrays and Strings
* Command-Line Interactions
* Exit Codes

#### Algorithms

In this module, students will explore algorithms more deeply, acquiring an appreciation of tradeoffs among algorithms and learning how to compare algorithms asymptotically.

* Searching
* Sorting
* Computational Complexity
* Computational Models

#### Memory

In this module, students will uncover some of the concepts that go on under the hood when we use different data structures like strings and arrays. Then students explore ways to store data of various types in a struct.

* Functions
* Tools for Debugging
* More on Strings
* Memory
* Pointers
* Structs
* Valgrind

#### Python

Students build upon their knowledge gained in the course to learn several new programming languages with abstractions built in that allow them to go far beyond what simply C and Scratch are able to do. They solve more complex problems that require processing large amounts of data and dealing with processes that scale and see how these techniques can be applied to confront the challenges computer scientists will be contending with in the future.

* Python
* Conditionals
* Booleans
* Loops
* Data Types
* Functions

#### SQL

Students learn about how applications store data in databases. They solve problems that require processing large amounts of data and dealing with processes that scale and see how these techniques can be applied to confront the challenges computer scientists will be contending with in the future.

* SQL

#### Web Track

At this point in the course, we transition from programming in a mostly command-line environment to taking our applications to scale via the Internet. First, however, students are introduced to the technologies underpinning this thing we know as “the Internet” before beginning to explore web programming by building simple pages of their own and making them accessible to the world via CS50 IDE.

Students build upon their knowledge of web programming and Python to create web-based applications. They learn about structures for organizing their files for web applications, like MVC.

* Internet Basics
* HTTP
* HTML
* Forms
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Autocomplete
* Events
* Cookies
* Sessions
* Flask
* MVC
* Ajax
* JSON

### AP Modules

The material in these chapters include topics that are not covered in CS50 on campus but are essential to the AP Computer Science Principles Course.

These modules are less programming focused and can be integrated at any point in the curriculum.

#### Data Science

In this module, students learn about big data. Students learn about how to collect and analyze data responsibly and how human bias can affect computation artifacts.

* Collecting Data
* Analyzing Data

#### Impact of Computing

In this module, students learn about how computing affects society. Students also dive into the development process from a high level and the ethics and legalities around computer science.

* The Development Process
* Scaling
* Models
* Simulations
* The Digital Divide
* Ethics and Legalities of Computing

### Create Performance Task

Students will be provided at least twelve (12) hours of dedicated class time to complete the Create: Applications from Ideas Performance Task [TCA].
