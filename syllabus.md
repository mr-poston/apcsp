## Course Introduction

CS50 is Harvard University’s introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming for students less comfortable and more comfortable alike. CS50 for AP Computer Science Principles is an adaptation of CS50 for high schools that aligns with the AP Computer Science Principles curriculum framework. The course assumes no prior background of students, but it is rigorous by design and programming-centric, engaging students with fundamentals of computer science by way of hands-on programming projects. The computational-thinking skills that students ultimately acquire are broadly applicable.

Among this course’s objectives is to supply students with a comprehensive introduction to the fundamentals of the discipline of computer science. We will do so using programming in several different languages as a vehicle to introduce these fundamentals, including such topics as algorithms, abstraction, data, global impact, and internet technologies. Though the course is programming-heavy, it should be stressed that this is not a “programming course”; rather, this course should be considered one of problem-solving, creativity, and exploration. By year’s end, students will have a richer understanding of the key principles of the discipline of computer science. They will be able to speak intelligently about how computers work and how they enable us to become better problem-solvers and will hopefully be able to communicate that knowledge to others.

Whether students elect to take no other computer science courses in their lifetime or consider this class the first step in a longer course of study, it is our sincere hope that students feel more comfortable with—and indeed sometimes skeptical of—the technologies that surround us each day.

## Prerequisites

The only background required for CS50 for AP Computer Science Principles is completion of Algebra I or its equivalent.

## Recommended Books

No books are required for this course. However, students may wish to supplement their preparation for or review of some material with self-assigned readings relevant to the material from either of the books below. The first is intended for those inexperienced in (or less comfortable with the idea of) programming. The second is intended for those experienced in (or more comfortable with the idea of) programming. Realize that free, if not superior, resources can be found on the course’s website or on the internet more generally.

### For Those Less Comfortable

*C Programming Absolute Beginner’s Guide*, 3rd Edition  
Greg Perry, Dean Miller  
Pearson Education, 2014  
ISBN 0-789-75198-4

### For Those More Comfortable

*Programming in C*, 4th Edition  
Stephen G. Kochan  
Pearson Education, 2015  
ISBN 0-321-77641-0

The following book is recommended for those interested in understanding more about how their own computers work, for personal edification.

*How Computers Work*, 10th Edition  
Ron White  
Que Publishing, 2014  
ISBN 0-7897-4984-X

Lastly, the following book is recommended for aspiring hackers—those interested in programming techniques and low-level optimization of code that goes beyond the scope of this course.

*Hacker’s Delight*, 2nd Edition  
Henry S. Warren, Jr.  
Pearson Education, 2013  
ISBN 0-321-84268-5

## Programming Environments

Several programming languages are taught in the course, and students are able to program in all of them in an environment designed specifically for the course called VSCode for CS50. Students will need to sign up for a (free) GitHub account in order to use VSCode for CS50.

VSCode for CS50 is a web-based utility with cloud storage, meaning students will be able to work on the course’s programming exercises at home, school, or anywhere they have an internet connection. Instructions for setting up and using VSCode for CS50 are provided in the first assignment requiring its use.

Additionally, students will use a drag-and-drop programming language called Scratch for some of the course’s early material. Scratch is similarly a web-based environment.

## Academic Honesty

This course’s philosophy on academic honesty is best stated as “be reasonable.” The course recognizes that interactions with classmates and others can facilitate mastery of the course’s material. However, there remains a line between enlisting the help of another and submitting the work of another. This policy characterizes both sides of that line.

The essence of all work that you submit to this course must be your own. Collaboration on problems is not permitted (unless explicitly stated otherwise) except to the extent that you may ask classmates and others for help so long as that help does not reduce to another doing your work for you. **Generally speaking, when asking for help, you may show your code or writing to others, but you may not view theirs, so long as you and they respect this policy’s other constraints.**

Collaboration on the course’s quizzes and tests is not permitted at all. Collaboration on the Create Performance Task is permitted to the extent prescribed by its specifications.

Below are examples that inexhaustibly characterize acts that the course considers reasonable and not reasonable. If in doubt as to whether some act is reasonable, do not commit it until you solicit and receive approval in writing from your instructor. If a violation of this policy is suspected and confirmed, your instructor reserves the right to impose an appropriate penalty.

### Reasonable

* Communicating with classmates about problems in English (or some other spoken language).
* Discussing the course’s material with others in order to understand it better.
* Helping a classmate identify a bug in his or her code, such as by viewing, compiling, or running his or her code, even on your own computer.
* Incorporating snippets of code that you find online or elsewhere into your own code, provided that those snippets are not themselves solutions to assigned problems and that you cite the snippets’ origins (as via comments in your code).
* Reviewing past years’ quizzes, tests, and solutions thereto.
* Sending or showing code that you’ve written to someone, possibly a classmate, so that he or she might help you identify and fix a bug.
* Sharing snippets of your own solutions to problems online so that others might help you identify and fix a bug or other issue.
* Turning to the web or elsewhere for instruction beyond the course’s own, for references, and for solutions to technical difficulties, but not for outright solutions to problems or your own Create Task.
* Whiteboarding solutions to problems with others using diagrams or pseudocode but not actual code.
* Working with (and even paying) a tutor to help you with the course, provided the tutor does not do your work for you.

### Not Reasonable

* Accessing a solution to some problem prior to (re-)submitting your own.
* Asking a classmate to see his or her solution to a problem before (re-)submitting your own.
* Decompiling, deobfuscating, or disassembling the sample solutions to problems available in CS50 IDE.
* Failing to cite (as with comments) the origins of code, writing, or techniques that you discover outside of the course’s own lessons and integrate into your own work, even while respecting this policy’s other constraints.
* Giving or showing to a classmate a solution to a problem when it is he or she, and not you, who is struggling to solve it.
* Looking at another individual’s work during a quiz or test.
* Paying or offering to pay an individual for work that you may submit as (part of) your own.
* Providing or making available solutions to problems to individuals who might take this course in the future.
* Searching for, soliciting, or viewing a quiz’s questions or answers prior to taking the quiz.
* Searching for or soliciting outright solutions to problems online or elsewhere.
* Splitting a problem’s workload with another individual and combining your work (unless explicitly authorized by the problem itself).
* Submitting (after possibly modifying) the work of another individual beyond allowed snippets.
* Submitting the same or similar work to this course that you have submitted or will submit to another.
* Using resources during a quiz or test beyond those explicitly allowed in the quiz’s or test’s instructions.
* Viewing another’s solution to a problem and basing your own solution on it.

## Assessment

Because computer science is not a discipline that only lends itself to questions of right and wrong but also how and why, this course’s assessment policy is designed to try to answer some or all of these questions. The course’s problems are evaluated along two axes: correctness and style.

#### Correctness

To what extent is your submission consistent with our specification and free of bugs or errors?

#### Style

To what extent is your submission readable (i.e., code is commented and indented with aptly named variables)?

To obtain a passing grade in the course, all students must ordinarily submit all assigned problems unless otherwise granted an exception in writing by the instructor.

## Overview

Consistent with the AP Computer Science Principles curriculum framework, the course’s material is organized around five so-called “big ideas” as well as six computational thinking practices. The five big ideas are:

1. Creative Development (CRD)
2. Data (DAT)
3. Algorithms and Programming (AAP)
4. Computing Systems and Networks (CSN)
5. Impact of Computing (IOC)

And the six computational thinking practices are:

1. Computational Solution Design
2. Algorithms and Program Development
3. Abstraction in Program Development
4. Code Analysis
5. Computing Innovations
6. Responsible Computing

Hello

Students learn the syntax specific to C. Here, they write their first program in a web-based programming environment called the CS50 IDE. [P1] [P3] [P4]

Fahrenheit

Students will write a program that converts a temperature in Celsius to Fahrenheit and explore bugs that might arise when dealing with imprecision relating to floats and division in C. [P1] [P3] [P2] [P4]

Cash This activity introduces students to greedy algorithms. Here, they will write a program that first asks the user how much change is owed and then outputs the minimum number of coins with which said change can be made. [P1] [P3] [P2] [P4]

Pennies

Students will create a file that calculates the amount that the user will have received in total by the end of the month (not just on the last day) if some initial amount is doubled on every day but the first, expressed not as pennies but as dollars and cents. [P1] [P3] [P2] [P4]

ISBN

Students will further build on the abstractions available to them in C. Here, they will explore iteration and loops by writing a program that prompts the user for an ISBN-10 and then reports (via printf) whether the number’s legitimate. The program’s last line of output should be either yes or no, nothing more, nothing less. [P1] [P3] [P2] [P4]

Mario

Students further their understanding of loops and their familiarity with the syntax of C, by creating a program that outputs the famous Mario pyramid using spaces and hashes. [P1] [P2] [P3] [P4]

Credit

Students will put the concepts from C together, using loops, iteration, booleans, and data types to implement a program that prompts the user for a credit card number and then reports (via printf) whether it is a valid American Express, MasterCard, or Visa card number, per the definitions of each’s format.

Students begin to interact with their programs at the command line, allowing them to run differently each time, instead of always doing the same thing. Here, students modify some of the previous problems to allow them to be run from the command line. [P3] [P4]

Calc

Students continue to interact with their programs at the command line. They will implement the basic features of calculators including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo. [P1] [P2] [P3] [P4]

Caesar

Students dive into cryptography—the transformation of “plaintexts” to instead be secret messages, and how we can use machines to do this for us. Here they implement their own version of a caesar cipher. [P1] [P2] [P3] [P4]

Vigenére

Furthering their understanding of cryptography, students will create a cipher more secure than a caesar cipher, a vigenére cipher, where a keyword is used to encrypt the message. [P1] [P2] [P3] [P4]

Crack

After learning about encrypting “plaintext,” students will explore the opposite. They will create a program, using varying levels of abstraction such as functions and libraries to help them decrypt encrypted passwords. [P1] [P2] [P3] [P4] [P6]

Whodunit

Students explore images in depth and the varying levels of abstraction used to represent an image, rooting back to the individual bits that compose the pixels within an image. They will both individually and in teams, modify bitmap images to extract a hidden image. Additionally, they will answer some questions about images more generally. [P1] [P2] [P3] [P4]

Resize

Diving deeper into bitmap manipulation, students will create a program that takes in a 24-bit uncompressed BMPs and scales it larger by a factor of n. [P1] [P2] [P3] [P4] [P5]

Recover

In this problem, students will receive the file of a corrupted memory card storing 50 jpegs. They will work in groups to use their knowledge of file I/O to read the images from the memory card and write them to new files, thus restoring the lost images. [P1] [P2] [P3] [P4] [P6]

The technologies of the internet can be complex, so students are challenged to explain in writing things concisely to a lay audience, cementing their understanding of these technologies by having to discuss them more casually. In 1500 words students will explain how the internet works to 3rd graders. [P3] [P5] [P6]

Defender of the Web

Students explore the notions of cyberattacks and cybersecurity and investigate in more detail some of the common types of attacks that impact websites today. [P1] [P3] [P5] [P6]

In accordance with Computing Innovation 3 [CI-3], students will explore Cybersecurity and the Internet and:

[A] Students will explain beneficial and harmful effects of at least one computing innovation on society, economy, or culture.
[B] Students will identify the data used in at least one computing innovation and explain how the data is consumed, produced, or transformed by the given computing innovation.
[C] Students will identify data privacy, security, or storage concerns for at least one computing innovation.
Students should likewise cover the following (in a total of 750-1,000 words):

What is the name of the attack? What type of attack is it?
Where did it come from? Who created it (if known), and why?
How did we find out about it - how was it caught?
What types of companies or individuals does it target?
How does it work? What components of the network does it attack, and from which end (client or server)?
What damage is it capable of doing? What information does it target?
Has a fix been found? How does it work? Has it been implemented in all websites/servers with potential vulnerabilities?
If applicable, how can we defend ourselves against this attack?
Homepage

Students create their own web pages, learn about permissions schemes, and make their creations accessible to the world. [P1] [P4] [P6]

Similarities

Students will write a program to determine segments of similar code between two sample submissions. [P1] [P2] [P3] [P4] [P6]

Survey
