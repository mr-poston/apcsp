# Problem Set 2

## What to Do

1. Log into [code.cs50.io](https://code.cs50.io/) using your GitHub account
2. Run `update50` in your codespace’s terminal window to ensure your codespace is up-to-date and, when prompted, click **Rebuild now**
3. Submit [Readability](readability.md)
4. Submit one of:
	* [Caesar](caesar.md), if feeling less comfortable
	* [Substitution](substitution.md), if feeling more comfortable
	
If you submit both Caesar and Substitution, I’ll record the higher of your two scores.

## When to Do It

By the due date.

## Advice

* Try out any of David’s programs from class via [Lecture 2](...index.md)’s examples.
* To see the manual pages for C functions, visit [manual.cs50.io](https://manual.cs50.io/).
* If you see any errors when compiling your code with `make`, focus first on fixing the very first error you see, scrolling up as needed. If unsure what it means, try asking `help50` for help. For instance, if trying to compile `readability`, and
	```
	make readability
	```
	is yielding errors, try running
	```
	help50 make readability
	```
	instead!
