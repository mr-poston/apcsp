# Problem Set 3

## What to Do

1. Log into [code.cs50.io](https://code.cs50.io/) using your GitHub account
2. Run `update50` in your codespace’s terminal window to ensure your codespace is up-to-date and, when prompted, click **Rebuild now**
3. Submit [Plurality](./plurality.md)
4. Submit one of:
    * [Runoff](./runoff.md), if feeling less comfortable
    * [Tideman](./tideman.md), if feeling more comfortable

If you submit both Runoff and Tideman, we’ll record the higher of your two scores.

## When to Do It

By the due date.

## Advice

* Try out any of David’s programs from class via Week 3’s sandboxes.
* If you see any errors when compiling your code with `make`, focus first on fixing the very first error you see, scrolling up as needed. If unsure what it means, try asking `help50` for help. For instance, if trying to compile `plurality`, and
    ```
    make plurality
    ```
    is yielding errors, try running
    ```
    help50 make plurality
    ```
    instead!
