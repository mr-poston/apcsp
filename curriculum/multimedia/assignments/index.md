* When might you want to use a GIF instead of a JPEG?

* When might you want to use a JPEG instead of a GIF?

* Even though these images are the same resolution (300 pixels by 200 pixels), the German GIF is smaller (i.e., fewer bytes) than the French GIF. Hypothesize why that might be.

_Keep in mind that “1-bit color” connotes two colors, black and white._

* If an image supports “8-bit color,” (roughly) how many colors does it support?

* If an image supports “24-bit color,” (roughly) how many colors does it support?

_Consider the video below._

Consider the childhood “flip book” below, each of whose pages has a slightly different drawing of a shape.

* In what way is a childhood “flip book” like a digital video?
