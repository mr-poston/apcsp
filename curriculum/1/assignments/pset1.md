# Problem Set 1

## What to do

1. Log into [code.cs50.io](https://code.cs50.io/) using your GitHub account and follow the on-screen instructions to set up your very own “codespace” for Visual Studio Code
2, Once your codespace has loaded, close any **Welcome** tabs that might have opened by default
3. Log into [submit.cs50.io](https://submit.cs50.io/) using your GitHub account and click **Authorize cs50** to activate `check50`
4. Run `update50` in your codespace’s terminal window to ensure your codespace is up-to-date and, if prompted, click **Rebuild now**
5. Submit [Hello](./hello.md)
6. Submit one of:
  * [this version of Mario](./marioless.md) if feeling less comfortable
  * [this version of Mario](./mariomore.md) if feeling more comfortable
7. Submit one of:
  * [Cash](./cash.md) if feeling less comfortable
  * [Credit](./credit.md) if feeling more comfortable

If you submit both versions of Mario, I’ll record the higher of your two scores. If you submit both Cash and Credit, I’ll record the higher of your two scores.

## Advice

* Try out any of David’s programs from class via [Unit 1](../index.md)’s source code.
* See CS50’s [style guide for C](https://cs50.readthedocs.io/style/c/) for tips on how to improve your code’s style.
* If you see any errors when compiling your code with make, focus first on fixing the very first error you see, scrolling up as needed. If unsure what it means, try asking `help50` for help. For instance, if trying to compile `hello`, and
  ```
  make hello
  ```
  is yielding errors, try running
  ```
  help50 make hello
  ```
  instead!
