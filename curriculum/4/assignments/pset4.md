# Problem Set 4

## What to Do

1. Log into [code.cs50.io](https://code.cs50.io/) using your GitHub account
2. Run `update50` in your codespace’s terminal window to ensure your codespace is up-to-date and, when prompted, click **Rebuild now**
3. Submit one of:
    * [this version of Filter](./filterless.md) if feeling less comfortable
    * [this version of Filter](filtermore.md) if feeling more comfortable
4. Submit [Recover](./recover.md)

If you submit both versions of Filter, we’ll record the higher of your two scores.

## Advice

* Try out any of David’s programs from Week 4.
* If you see any errors when compiling your code with `make`, focus first on fixing the very first error you see, scrolling up as needed. If unsure what it means, try asking `help50` for help. For instance, if trying to compile `filter`, and
    ```
    make filter
    ```
    is yielding errors, try running
    ```
    help50 make filter
    ```
    instead!
