# Problem Set 5

## What to Do

1. Log into [code.cs50.io](https://code.cs50.io/) using your GitHub account
2. Run `update50` in your codespace’s terminal window to ensure your codespace is up-to-date and, when prompted, click **Rebuild now**
3. Submit [Speller](./speller.md)

## When to Do It

By the College Board’s AP deadlines for the 2022–2023 academic year.

## Advice

* Try out any of David’s programs from Week 5.
* If you see any errors when compiling your code with `make`, focus first on fixing the very first error you see, scrolling up as needed. If unsure what it means, try asking `help50` for help. For instance, if trying to compile `speller`, and
    ```
    make speller
    ```
    is yielding errors, try running
    ```
    help50 make speller
    ```
    instead!
